# SMTP-Server
Very poorly coded SMTP Server

Does actual work (tested with sendinblue / brevo, gmail, and icloud)

I reversed engineered gmail's SMTP, and sendinblue to build it, as I for whatever reason never chose to actually just google how smtp works.

I made this a while ago, just decided to upload code now, so don't judge.

Uploads to a database.

I suprising remembered to delete the database credentials from it, unlike with the imap server.

I cannot remmember but a fair amount is likley made using GPT 3
